(Warning: Only 18+ here)

Hi! This is where I store all my recording for SF-Girls
I am lacking in quite a few scenes + other stuff, so would appreciate for any contributions
How to contribute? 
1) DM me on Discord silentdeathsong_scip and I will upload for you
2) Create a branch and then upload the videos, then create a pull request (Just Dm me...save yourself the trouble of setting this up. I spent 3h trying to get this to work (2.35am > 5.31am) lol

Please note that the "TBC_GIF" File are speed up version of the H-secnes, meant to only capture the animations. This was a worst case resort where I "remake" the click-play feature 

Cheers! Lets look forward to SF-girls2! (Confirmed by the dev, they even made a discord server of it!)
PS also let me know if there are typo thx
